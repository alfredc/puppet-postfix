= Postfix Puppet module

This module will help install and configure postfix.

A couple of classes will preconfigure postfix for common needs.

Config
------
- set $postfix_use_amavisd="yes" to include postfix::amavis
- set $postfix_anon_sasl="yes" to hide the originating IP in email
  relayed for an authenticated SASL client; this needs Postfix
  2.3 or later to work; beware! Postfix logs the header replacement
  has been done, which means that you are storing this information,
  unless you are anonymizing your logs.
- set $postfix_manage_header_checks="yes" to manage header checks (see
  postfix::header_checks for details)
- set $postfix_manage_tls_policy="yes" to manage TLS policy (see
  postfix::tlspolicy for details)

== Example:

  include postfix

  postfix::config { "relay_domains": value  => "localhost host.foo.com" }
